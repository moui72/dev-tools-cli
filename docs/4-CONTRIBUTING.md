Tools and ecosystem for development.

## Pre-commit

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce style and manage code quality. Please run `pre-commit install` after cloning so that the hooks will run when you commit.

## Poetry

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to manage dependencies and build the package. You will need to install it.

## Building docs

> :warning: Do not edit README.md manually, any changes will be overwritten by docs autogeneration!

This project uses the [typer-cli](https://typer.tiangolo.com/typer-cli/#generate-docs) to generate the usage documentation. The `README.md` is a concatenation of those autogenerated docs (the [`dev`](#dev) section) as well as some static markdown files, like this one. The static markdown files are in the `scripts` directory and can be edited.

Run `sh scripts/make_docs` or `pre-commit run --hook-stage manual` to autogenerate a new `README.md` file.
